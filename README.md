# AntSimulator

A program which tracks the movement of ants following pheromone trails. An initial trail can be included in the simulation, as well as pheromone trails which are created by each ant in the simulation (which are updated as the simulation progresses). The ants in the simulation use telescopic navigation to read and follow pheromones, a method in which the ants use the differing strengths in the signals picked up by their 2 antennae to interpret and follow trails.
